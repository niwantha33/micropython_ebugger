# boot_dual_cdc.py — upload to the Pico 2 W as `boot.py`
#
# Phase 2 proof: adds a SECOND USB-CDC interface at boot.
# After reboot, Windows should show TWO COM ports for the board.
#
# Safety:
#   - 3-second window before activation — press Ctrl-C in the REPL to abort
#   - Entire thing is try/except so failures can't brick the REPL
